# Go-Module-Practice

the files inside this repo are for development 
the development of the modules once finished will be pushed to there own github repo for hosting 

example: The toolkit module is currently developed within this repo.
    When development is finished, toolkit will be moved and deployed as an independent GitHub repository, likely retaining the same module name.
